# Model Based RL

This homework is asks you to code a few model-based RL algorithms. 


## Complete the code

The following files have blanks to be filled with your solutions from homework 1. The relevant sections are marked with `TODO: get this from Piazza'.

- [infrastructure/rl_trainer.py](roble/infrastructure/rl_trainer.py)
- [infrastructure/utils.py](roble/infrastructure/utils.py)

You will then need to implement code in the following files:
- [agents/mb_agent.py](roble/agents/mb_agent.py)
- [models/ff_model.py](roble/models/ff_model.py)
- [policies/MPC_policy.py](roble/policies/MPC_policy.py)

The relevant sections are marked with `TODO`.

You may also want to look through [run_hw2_mb.py](run_hw2_mb.py) (if running locally) or [run_hw2_mb.ipynb](run_hw2_mb.ipynb) (if running on Colab), though you will not need to edit this files beyond changing runtime arguments in the Colab notebook.
