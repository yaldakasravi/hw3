# Setup

You can run this code on your own machine or on Google Colab (Colab is not completely supported). 

1. **Local option:** If you choose to run locally, you will need to install MuJoCo and some Python packages; see [installation.md](installation.md) from homework 1 for instructions. There are two new package requirements (`opencv-python` and `gym[atari]`) beyond what was used in the previous assignments; make sure to install these with `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you are running the assignment locally.

2. **Docker:** You can also run this code in side of a docker image. You will need to build the docker image using the provided docker file

3. **Colab:** The first few sections of the notebook will install all required dependencies. You can try out the Colab option by clicking the badges below:
